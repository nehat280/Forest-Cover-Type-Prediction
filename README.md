# Forest-Cover-Type-Prediction
This notebook aims to classify 7 different types of trees (**Multiclass Classification**)and give some clues about where to find them. I built an extra random forest classifier to detect fantastic trees in he Roosevelt National Forest of northern Colorado.I have implemented Decision Tree and Random Forest Classification for Classification.
Using Random Forest i was able to achieve 81.3% accuracy on testing model.

**Libraries used:**
1. Pandas
2. Numpy
3. Plotly, Seaborn, Matplotlib for visualization
4. sklearn(Decision Tree and Random Forest) for modelling.




**The notebook will follow the workflow:**

1. Understand, Clean and Format Data

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

    2.1. Univariate Analysis
    
    2.2. Bivariate Analysis

3. Training model with all features

4. Feature Engineering & Selection 

    4.1 Adding Additional Features

5. Fitting the Model with best features.

      5.1. Decision tree model

      5.2. Random Forest Classifier
  
          5.2.1. Hyper Parameter on Random Forest


6. Visualization of the best model using Confusion Matrix.


7. Interpret Model Results


8. Where to Find these Trees?
